# TFG-Miriam-Colino-Ruiperez

This repository contains the code used on the final degree thesis by Miriam Colino Ruip√©rez: Detection of network and information systems attacks using Deep Learning techniques on the year 2022/2023.

TFGMiriamColinoRuiperez.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file in which the following parts can be found:
- Data filtering
- SMOTE and separation in set train and test
- SGD model
- Logistic Regression Model
- Decision Tree Model
- Random forest model
- KNN model
- Neural network
- Ensemble model formed by the three models with the highest accuracy. 

For each model several performance evaluation metrics are used:
- Confusion matrix and classification report.
- ROC curve
- Accuracy per class 
- Feature importance (in Decision Tree and Random forest)
- Comparative graphs between models (execution time and accuracy)

In addition, for each model an adjustment of its hyperparameters has been made.
